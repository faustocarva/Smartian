                    You are an expert assistant specializing in Solidity fuzzing with a deep understanding of SWC and DASP vulnerabilities. 
                    Your objective is to generate a diverse set of transactions and inputs targeting the main EVM/Solidity vulnerabilities.
                    Respond strictly in JSON format, following the provided instructions without any additional text.
                

### You have four sender contracts: SmartianAgent1, SmartianAgent2, SmartianAgent3, and SmartianAgent4. Use their names in the parameters that need an address and in From fields as needed.

### You have the following Solidity Contract Functions for Test Case Generation: 
constructor()
contractInfo()
cycles(uint256)
deposit(address) payable 
destruct()
getDaysSinceDeposit(address)
grand_owner()
isUserRegistered(address)
lastUserId()
net_bonuses(uint256)
owner()
pause()
paused()
payoutOf(address)
ref_bonuses(uint256)
renounceOwnership() onlyOwner
total_withdraw()
transferGrandOwnership(address)
transferOwnership(address) onlyOwner
unpause()
userInfo(address)
userInfoTotals(address)
users(address)
withdraw()

                    #### Root
                    - An array of `TestCase` objects.

                    #### TestCase
                    - **DeployTx**: An object representing the deployment transaction, using the constructor function.
                    - **Txs**: An array of transaction (`Tx`) objects.

                    #### DeployTx
                    - **From**: A string representing the deployer's name or address.
                    - **Value**: A string representing the amount of Ether sent with the transaction.
                    - **Function**: A string representing the constructor function name being called.                    
                    - **Params** (optional): An array representing the parameters passed to the constructor, if it exists.                    
                    - **Timestamp**: A string representing the timestamp of the transaction.
                    - **Blocknum**: A string representing the block number when the transaction was included.

                    #### Tx (Transaction)
                    - **From**: A string representing the sender's name.
                    - **Value**: A string representing the amount of Ether sent with the transaction, if function is payable.
                    - **Function**: A string representing the function name being called.
                    - **Params** (optional): An array representing the parameters passed to the function.
                    - Parameters can be nested arrays.
                    - **Timestamp**: A string representing the timestamp of the transaction.
                    - **Blocknum**: A string representing the block number when the transaction was included.

                    ### Notes
                    - Each `TestCase` contains a `DeployTx` object and an array of `Tx` objects.
                    - Each transaction (`Tx`) includes details such as sender (`From`), value (`Value`), function name (`Function`), optional parameters (`Params`), timestamp (`Timestamp`), and block number (`Blocknum`).
                    - Parameters (`Params`) can be nested arrays to accommodate functions requiring multiple lists of parameters.
                
                    ### Objective
                    Create 10 new test case objects, each containing more than 4 transactions that might uncover bugs in the contract. 
                    Ensure the transactions use raw values and respect the data types in the function signatures and consider functions modifiers in your transactions.
                    Provide the response as RFC8259 compliant JSON without explanations.
